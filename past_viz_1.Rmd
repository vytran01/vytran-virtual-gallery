title: "Scatterplot on Multiple Variables"
description: |
  One of the past visualizations that I found most impressive is a scatterplot representing 4 variables of the `survey` data set on a same plot
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

<!--
```{r}
library(MASS)
library(wesanderson)
data(survey)
``` 

```{r}
survey$Smoke = factor(survey$Smoke, levels = c("Heavy", "Regul", "Occas", "Never"), ordered = TRUE)
survey$Exer = factor(survey$Exer, levels = c("Freq", "Some", "None"), ordered = TRUE)
```

-->


<h2>Data set</h2>

<b>survey</b> is a data set taken from the MASS library, containing the responses of 237 students on 12 variables.

<h2>Variables</h2>

This visualization illustrates the relationship of 4 variables: 

<ul>
  <li>Pulse (pulse rate): int</li>
  <li>Height: num</li>
  <li>Smoke (smoking frequency): factor</li>
  <li>Exer (exercise frequency): factor</li>
</ul>


```{r}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = Pulse, y = Height, color = Smoke, shape = Exer)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2.5) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("FantasticFox1")[2:6]) + 
  labs(color = "Smoking Frequency", shape = "Exercise Frequency")
```

<h2>Interpretations</h2>

- Each observation is represented by a dot on the scatterplot
- The x-axis represents `Pulse`, the y-axis represents `Height`, the shape of each dot represented the `Smoke` category, and the color of each dot represents the `Exercise` category.
- Since the dots scatter all over the visualization without any clear pattern, it is likely that there is no linear relationship between Pulse and Height. This can be confirm as the correlation between these 2 variables is around -0.08, which is very small.

```{r}
complete_survey <- survey[complete.cases(survey), ]
cor(complete_survey$Pulse, complete_survey$Height)
```

- Since red dots outnumber other colors, the majority of students in this survey never smoke. We also observe no correlation between `Smoke` and other variables

```{r}
table(survey$Smoke)
```

- The circles and triangles outnumber squares, so the number of students doing exercise frequently/sometimes are higher than those who never do exercise.

```{r}
table(survey$Exer)
```
