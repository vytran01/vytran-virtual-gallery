title: "Ggplot Extension Project"
description: |
   Ggplot is a versatile R package renowned for its expansive collection of data visualization tools. Through this project, I learned how to use a new ggplot library by investigating related documentations on my own and explained the concept to people who are unfamiliar with it. In addition, I also learned about 6 other packages from my classmates; many of those packages were later implemented in my final website. In this project, I was working specifically on ggcorrplot, a wonderful package to visualize the correlation matrix between multiple variables in a dataset
---

<h2>Data set</h2>
<b>BodyFat</b> is a dataframe that contains 100 observations on 10 variables: 
    Bodyfat, Age, Weight, Height, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, Ankle, Biceps, and Wrist. All of these variables 
    are numerical, which is a requirement to create a correlation matrix.
    
Since this data set is not too large, I will use all 10 variables to analyze the correlation between any pair
        of physiologic measurements


<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>correlation</b> between two variables measures the degree to which movements in one variable correspond
        to movements in another.
        A correlation ranges between -1 (perfect negative relationship) and 1 (perfect positive relationship).
        The absolute value of a correlation indicates the strength of that relationship.
        A correlation of 0 means no linear relationship.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <b>correlation matrix</b> is a table showing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables.
        Each cell in the table represents the correlation of the two corresponding variables.
    </li>
</ul>

<!--
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(Lock5Data)
data(BodyFat)
```
-->

```{r}
corr = round(cor(BodyFat), 1)
ggcorrplot(corr)
```

<h2>Interpretation of the visualization</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This visualization is a 10x10 grid corresponding to 10 variables in the data set</li>
    <li>Each cell is colored based on the correlation coefficient between the variable on the corresponding
        row and column. The more intense the color, the stronger the relationship</li>
    <li>This plot contains mostly of orange/red cells (with different brightness), indicating many pairs of variables in
        this data set have a positive relationship.</li>
    <li>The anti-diagonal is all red (i.e. correlation = 1) because the correlation coefficient of a variable with itself is
        always 1</li>
    <li>The colors are symmetric about the anti-diagonal because each pair of variable are repeated twice</li>
    <li>Looking at the visualization, some pairs with a strong, linear, positive correlation include (Abdomen, Chest), (Abdomen, Weight), (Chest, Weight), (Neck, Wrist), etc </li>
    <li>Some pairs with very weak or nearly no linear relationship are (BodyFat, Height), (Age, Neck), (Age, Ankle), etc </li>
</ul>

<h2>Add-ons</h2>
<p>The <b>ggcorrplot</b> package provides many options to customize the correlation matrix by specifying optional parameters like
type, colors, ggtheme, lab, etc. Below are some versions of the correlation matrix using the same data set
</p>

<h3>Version 1</h3>
```{r}
ggcorrplot(
  corr,
  hc.order = TRUE,
  type = "lower",
  colors = c("darkgreen", "white", "yellow"),
  ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_dark,
  lab = TRUE,
  legend.title = "Correlation",
  title = "Correlation matrix for 10 physiologic measurements"
)
```

<h3>Some modifications made in version 1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        In this new version, the matrix cells are reordered based on their similarity in terms of correlation,
        giving us a sense of closely related variables
    </li>
    <li>
        Because a correlation matrix is always symmetric about its diagonal axis, I choose to display only the lower
        half of its to reduce the complexity of the matrix
    </li>
    <li>
        I also added the correlation value on each cell, which serves as an additional indicator and conforms to the
        accessibility principles
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Version 2 </h3>
```{r}
ggcorrplot(
  corr,
  method = "circle",
  hc.order = TRUE,
  type = "lower",
  ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_minimal,
  legend.title = "Correlation",
  title = "Correlation matrix for 10 physiologic measurements"
)
```

<h3>Some modifications made in version 2</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Instead of using numerical values as an "it factor", I used the size of circles, which is indeed proportional to the strength of the corresponding correlation
    </li>
    <li>
        This graph is quite intuitive to visualize the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.
        For example, we can easily tell that Abdomen and Weight have a strong positive linear relationship (due to the big red circle) while Age has nothing to do with Neck (due to the small white circle)
    </li>
</ul>
